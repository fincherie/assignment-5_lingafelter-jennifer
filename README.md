# Assignment 5

## Link to repository

Once again, I used [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) for this project and my JavaScript book from last semester to help with the functions.

## Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

## Comments and Feedback
I am finally understanding parts of javascript and especially functions.  I really liked the listening events and was able to follow the methodology of listening for an event and then running a function.  I am still having a bit of a hard time styling and positioning elements and am going to study some of my peers' code on GitHub.
